## Introduction ##

This is my solution to the Semantic Segmentation project of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program. The goal for the project is to label the pixels of a road in images using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN).

### Setup

##### Frameworks and Packages
Following tools are needed:
 - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
 - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
 - [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
 - [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
##### Dataset

[Kitti Road dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_road.php) from [here](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip).

##### Run
Run the following command to run the project:
```
python main.py
```
